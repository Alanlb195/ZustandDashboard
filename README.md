# React + TypeScript + Vite + Zustand + TailwindCSS + ReactRouterDom

This project is a dashboard-style exercise using Zustand as the state management solution. The main objective is to implement and document practical use cases for Zustand, which can later serve as a reference or be reused in future applications.

To run this project in development mode:


1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies `npm install`
3. Start the development server `npm run dev`


### Tech Stack

- React – UI library
- TypeScript – Type-safe development
- Vite – Build tool for fast development
- Zustand – Lightweight state management
- TailwindCSS – Utility-first CSS framework
- React Router DOM – Routing library for React


Purpose
This repository is meant to act as a personal knowledge base for state management patterns using Zustand. Each implementation attempts to be as reusable, clear, and modular as possible. The goal is to better understand state handling in modern React applications and to build a solid foundation for future projects.

### Course Reference
This project was developed as a learning exercise based on the course
